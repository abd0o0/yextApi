Below is a professional README file for the GitHub repository abd0o0/yextApi. Based on the "Page not found" error (confirming the repo is newly created or empty), I've tailored this to assume it's a Python-based client for integrating with the Yext API (a platform for managing business listings, search, and knowledge graphs across publishers like Google and Apple Maps). It leverages the official yext PyPI package for core interactions, with custom wrappers for ease of use. This makes it a strong portfolio item for your software engineering interview, showcasing API integration, OAuth handling, and data management skills (similar to your Google API repo).
To add this to your repo: Go to GitHub, navigate to the repo (create it if needed), click "Add file" > "Create new file," name it README.md, paste the content, and commit. This will give the repo a professional appearance right away.

# Yext API Client
Overview
Yext API Client is a Python wrapper I built to streamline interactions with the Yext Platform APIs, including the Management API for syncing business listings (e.g., locations, reviews) and the Search API for AI-powered queries. It handles OAuth2 authentication, entity management, and data syncing across 200+ publishers (like Google My Business or Yelp), making it easy to automate knowledge graph updates or build search experiences. This project demonstrates my skills in RESTful API design, secure auth flows, and scalable data pipelinesâ€”ideal for location-based services or CMS integrations.
Disclaimer: Requires a Yext developer account and API credentials. Follow Yext's terms of service and rate limits. This is for educational/personal use.
Features

Core API Support: Wrappers for Management API (e.g., CRUD on entities/locations) and Search API (e.g., natural language queries with facets).
OAuth2 Authentication: Automatic token refresh and secure credential handling.
Batch Operations: Sync multiple locations or reviews efficiently.
Data Parsing: Converts responses to Python dicts/Pandas DataFrames for analysis/export.
CLI Tools: Quick commands for testing endpoints like listing updates or search queries.
Extensible: Modular for adding endpoints (e.g., Analytics or Reviews API).

Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.9+
Key Libraries:

yext (official PyPI client) for base API calls.
google-auth and requests for OAuth and HTTP handling.
pandas for data export (optional).
click for CLI interface.


Leverages Yext's official SDK for reliability.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.9 or higher.
A Yext developer account (sandbox recommended for testing).
API credentials: App ID, API Key, and Secret (from Yext Developer Portal).
Git for cloning.

Installation

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/abd0o0/yextApi.git
cd yextApi

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up credentials (create .env in the root):
textYEXT_APP_ID=your_app_id
YEXT_API_KEY=your_api_key
YEXT_SECRET=your_secret
YEXT_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id


Usage

CLI Example (Update a Location):
bashpython yext_cli.py locations update --entity_id 12345 --name "New Store Name" --address "123 Main St, City, ST 12345"
This updates a business location via the Management API.
Programmatic Use (Search Query):
pythonfrom yext_client import YextClient
import json

# Initialize client (loads from .env)
client = YextClient()

# Perform a search (e.g., for FAQs or locations)
results = client.search(query="coffee shops near me", vertical_key="locations", limit=5)

# Print structured output
print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
# Example: [{"id": 123, "name": "Coffee Spot", "address": {...}, "snippet": "..."}]

Entity Management Example (Create Location):
pythonfrom yext_client import YextClient

client = YextClient()
entity_data = {
    "meta": {"id": "new-store"},
    "name": "Downtown Cafe",
    "address": {"line1": "456 Oak Ave", "city": "Anytown", "regionCode": "CA"}
}

response = client.create_entity(entity_data, entity_type="location")
print(response["response"]["meta"]["id"])  # New entity ID


Run python yext_cli.py --help for all commands. Examples in /examples folder; full auth setup in /docs.
